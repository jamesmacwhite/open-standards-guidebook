title: Typical outputs for developing open standards checklist
layout: content-page
description: Developing open standards for data means combining elements of a technical activity, stakeholder coordination and community engagement. Use this checklist to track typical outputs at each stage.
---

## Scoping & starting
- [ ] **Stakeholder map**: Listing who will use or be affected by your open standard or its outputs - include your early adopters, the first to engage with the standard
- [ ] **Scoping document**: Detailing why the open standard is being developed, the need it meets or problem it solves, the vision for the standard, and what is in and out of scope
- [ ] **Use cases**: Outlining step by step how your stakeholders will use your open standard or its outputs to meet their need or solve their problem
- [ ] **Governance guidelines**: Detailing initial decisions about how the standard will be managed
- [ ] **Intellectual property guidelines**: Outlining who owns intellectual property on contributions and outputs
- [ ] **License document**: Detailing the open license that applies to your open standard and to contributions
- [ ] **Communication channels**: To help you keep in touch with your community, for example, online forums, newsletters, social media, offline meetups, and groups

## Development

- [ ] **Open standard**: Stable machine and human-readable forms the standard
- [ ] **Tutorials**: Documentation suitable for beginners or newcomers that supports learning how to use the standard or its output.
- [ ] **Explanations**: Articles aimed at improving understanding by giving context, for example, explaining how the standard is being used by early adopters
- [ ] **How-to guides**: Exploring how to adopt, use or implement the standard (or its outputs) step-by-step to solve a problem or meet a need
- [ ] **References**: Concise documentation that provide technical descriptions, for example, human-readable versions of the open standard
- [ ] **Peer experiences**: Detailing early adopters experiences to provide guidance to others and feedback for the review stage
- [ ] **Translations**: Multilingual translation of the open standard, associated documentation and website content (if necessary to support other languages)
- [ ] **Tools**: For converting, validating and viewing data that uses the standard and code libraries for processing or analysing the standard
- [ ] **Test suites of data**: Data that both conforms to and breaks the standard to demonstrate scenarios adopters will encounter, handle or report

## Launch & adoption

- [ ] **Stakeholder map**: Listing who will use or be affected by your open standard or its outputs - updated to include new stakeholders who have adopted the standard
- [ ] **Registered adopters**: Listing people and organisations who have registered in forums, been in touch or attended workshops and events - this will help to understand the makeup of your community
- [ ] **Adoption statistics**: Tracking the people, organisations and applications using the standard that will help to understand how the standard is being used
- [ ] **Communication statistics**: Analysing the reach of the launch event, where the open standard is being mentioned and by whom

## Review

- [ ] **Review documentation**: Documenting the review process including who was involved, what was considered and why, and how this impacted the decision
- [ ] **Review decision**: Detailing the decision on the future of the open standard which may be to update and maintain it, to update and re-scope it, or to retire the standard
- [ ] **Communication releases**: Listing location of press releases, blog posts, announcements or other communications with stakeholders to explain the decision 

## Update

- [ ] **Development outputs**: All items listed in the development section 
- [ ] **List of changes**: Detailing whatâ€™s new or updated for guiding the development process and sharing with the community
- [ ] **Translations**: Updated multilingual translation of the open standard, associated documentation and website content (if necessary to support other languages)

## Retire

- [ ] **Archived content**: Archiving a final version of the open standard, documentation and guides, and website content in an archiving service like [Internet Archive](https://archive.org)
- [ ] **Notice of retirement**: Detailing the retirement of the standard, what this means for the community and any actions that can be taken in future
