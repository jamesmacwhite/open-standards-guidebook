# Why use existing open standards?

Open standards are useful tools, however, creating a successful open standard is both time and resource intensive. 

<div class="callout" markdown="1">
**Activities include:**

* developing the standard

* producing documentation 

* coordinating stakeholders

* engaging with the community

* managing change effectively
</div>

Consider using an existing open standard where possible. This may mean using an existing standard in its current form, adapting or extending it to meet your needs.

# Ways to find open standards

According to our research, ‘[User experiences of open standards for data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E5uARrZf5AJUIF_DJz-42_793EY_Dwk7n7B3bMn3x5A/edit?usp=sharing)’, people who know about open standards tend to find existing open standards through both formal and informal networks.

<div class="callout" markdown="1">
**You can find existing open standards through:**

* [formal standards bodies](https://www.iso.org/members.html)

* conferences

* standards teams or working groups

* websites, blogs or social media

* open source projects or repositories like [Github](https://github.com/)
</div>

Open standards tend to have dedicated websites to help potential adopters find standards using search engines. 

For example, [Open Referral](https://openreferral.org/) for community resources, the [Open Contracting Data Standard](http://standard.open-contracting.org/) for disclosing public procurement and the [Humanitarian Exchange Standard](http://hxlstandard.org/) for humanitarian crises, all of which have dedicated websites.

Some open standards are listed by the governments and public bodies who support them, for example the [UK government list of approved open standards](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-standards-for-government), the [U.S. Data Federation](https://federation.data.gov/) and [Ireland’s open standards](https://data.gov.ie/openstandard).

Finding open standards then working out if they are right for you can be time consuming. 

Resources like directories and case studies have been developed to make the research process easier. The [Open data standards directory](http://datastandards.directory/), the [Civic open data standards by Azavea](https://azavea.gitbooks.io/open-data-standards/content/) and [GeoThink’s dashboard for open data standards](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12wcUhE6waDz0RPT81E5aebcJf58AH92FstMZQKy5kRc/edit#gid=1514863604) are useful resources that help you search for and assess open standards.

More resources are listed in our guide ‘[Tools to find open standards](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iTCCFu7WRx5Ak11MtPvApphkutaaPVxOzy0L2NnwWYM/edit?usp=sharing)’.
