# Page templates

The files in this directory provide commented templates that can be used when creating new pages in the site.

The following templates are available:

- Content page
- Listing page
- Podcast page
- Case study page
- Resource list page
- Homepage

The template that the site will render is determined by the `layout` key in each page's front matter - be sure to set the correct `layout` value or the page will not render as expected!
