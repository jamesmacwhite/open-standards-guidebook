description: 'This guidebook helps people and organisations create, develop and adopt open standards for data. It supports a variety of users, including policy leads, domain experts and technologists.'
---

The open standards for data guidebook was developed and published by the Open Data Institute in 2018. It is intended to support people and organisations to create, develop and adopt open standards for data.

### Background

The ODI’s [innovation programme](https://theodi.org/project/research-and-development-of-data-innovation-for-uk-government/) kicked off in July 2017 to advance knowledge and expertise in how data can shape the next generation of services, and create economic growth. The funds for it were awarded through Innovate UK, the UK’s innovation agency, in a three-year programme, running to March 2020 with a funding profile of £2m each year.

The projects are aimed at advancing our understanding of the opportunities data can bring and some of the pitfalls to avoid. They are intended to enable the UK to build on its established strengths in data and data analytics, break new ground in creating value from data across industry, and ensure that the UK remains at the forefront of data innovation globally.

This guidebook was produced as part of a project to exploring how to make it quicker and easier for organisations to create open standards for data. 

The project consisted of three phases:

* [Working with four partners to document approaches to creating open standards](https://theodi.org/article/documenting-the-development-of-open-standards-for-data/)
* Desk and user research to [explore approaches to adoption and development of open standards](https://theodi.org/article/open-standards-for-data-adoption-approaches-and-impact/)
* Development and testing of this guidebook
