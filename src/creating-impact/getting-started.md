# Understand The Ecosystem

Understanding the ecosystem your standard will operate in can help establish what’s valued by stakeholders. Ecosystem maps help you understand where and how value is created, and what can be done to support value creation.

Ecosystem maps help identify players, environmental conditions and the relationships between them. Once the ecosystem is mapped, you can establish where your open standard fits and the value it can provide. By providing value to stakeholders, your open standard is more likely to be adopted and create impact.

# Solve Clearly Defined Problems

In our research, [User Experiences of Open Standards for Data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E5uARrZf5AJUIF_DJz-42_793EY_Dwk7n7B3bMn3x5A/edit?usp=sharing), we found that a successful standard is a useful standard. The people we interviewed suggested that a successful open standard for data focuses on solving a particular problem or need.

The suggestions are supported by our research, [Exploring the Development and Impact of Open Standards for Data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Sab5YMVj4PVqLjZD35hX8FTnMeeP6gLGG0xszuRMIaM/edit?usp=sharing), where we found active open standards with thriving communities focused on solving particular problems.

For example, Google’s [General Transit Feed Specification](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/) (GTFS) focuses on making it easy to share and use public transit information and the [Open Contracting Data Standard](http://standard.open-contracting.org/) focuses on disclosing public procurement information.

# Work With Other Standards

Open standards are part of an ecosystem which means there are likely competing and complementary standards already in use. Ensuring your standard works well with others not only makes it interoperable, it increases the value of the standard to stakeholders.

An open standard can work with other standards by using their:

* **established vocabulary** rather than creating new language, identifiers or codes - the [International Aid Transparency Initiative](http://iatistandard.org/) (IATI) open standard for aid transparency re-uses [Organisation Registration Agency ](http://iatistandard.org/202/codelists/OrganisationRegistrationAgency/)codes from a number of authoritative and established registrars including the UK’s [Companies House](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/companies-house)

* **technical formats**, adopting supported open formats like csv or json over proprietary formats - the [Fiscal Data Package](https://frictionlessdata.io/specs/fiscal-data-package/#overview) standard for government budgets uses the [json](https://json.org/) format for packages and plain text [csv](https://theodi.org/blog/the-status-of-csvs-on-datagovuk) format for data files

* **models** developed to map and understand ecosystems and information flow - the [Open311](http://www.open311.org/learn/) collaborative model for civic issue tracking has been adapted by City of Chicago, with the help of [Code for America](http://codeforamerica.org/) to meet the city’s needs

Open standards can also treat other standards as ways to extend the features available to stakeholders. For example, governments disclose public procurement information such as tenders, awards and contracts. They also disclose budgets and spending.

Including all of this information in a single standard would make it verbose and dilute its focus. Instead, governments can use the [Open Contracting Data Standard](http://standard.open-contracting.org/) to disclose public procurement and the [Fiscal Data Package](https://frictionlessdata.io/specs/fiscal-data-package/#overview) standard to disclose budgets. Both disclosures can be linked using reference numbers allowing developers to easily link procurement and budgets.

# Deliver A Robust Product

An emerging theme from our user research was the robustness of open standards: open standards developed collaboratively with a variety of people and organisations and tested to ensure it is fit for purpose.

Including a wide variety of stakeholders ensures the open standard isn’t focused too narrowly and provides a required solution. Testing the standard ensures that assumptions are clarified and errors are spotted early. A robust standard does not need to be verbose - it focuses on the core and critical features stakeholders need to adopt and use the standard. This allows the standard to launch, be adopted by stakeholders and evolve with their needs.
