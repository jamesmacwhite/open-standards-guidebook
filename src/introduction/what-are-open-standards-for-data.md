## What Are Standards?

Standards are documented, reusable agreements that solve a specific set of problems. Standards detail the language, concepts, rules, guidance or results that have been agreed. Standards are used when it’s important to be consistent, repeat processes, make comparisons or reach a shared understanding.

Standards are used in every sector across the world to capture agreements on physical items, concepts, ideas, digital products, and processes.

Everyday standards include:

* standards for electrical sockets that allow any appliance to plug in seamlessly
* standard for addresses that makes post delivery more efficient
* standard units of measurement for drinks that makes bar service faster and easier
* standardised sizes for nuts and bolts that makes buying and selling more cost effective

## What are Open Standards for Data?

An open standard is a standard that’s available for anyone to access and use (NOTE:  See: ITU Definition of Open Standards[^1]. Open standards for data help people and organisations to publish, access, share and use better quality data.

Open standards tend to be developed to:

* agree on common models or a common language
* share information consistently
* make information aggregation simpler and more streamlined
* create social change or implement policy and legislation
* promote common understanding in a community of practice


## Examples of Open Standards for Data

* [General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS)](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/), the de facto standard for public transit makes it easy to find bus, train, and tram stops and schedules when you use apps like [CityMapper](https://citymapper.com), [Google Maps](https://maps.google.com/) or ride sharing apps like [Park.io](https://www.parkio.co.uk/)

* In England, [local planning authorities](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Hv_g2wt3vJ42XJxK6nsLax0M_9c76rFC4JerFYm2x0U/edit#bookmark=id.x2fknj1by9n0) use the [Brownfield Site Register Open Data Standard](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/brownfield-land-registers-data-standard) to share the location and condition of sites suitable for residential development

* The US [Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)](https://www.epa.gov/) use [open standards for environmental data](https://www.epa.gov/data-standards) and a central data exchange to significantly reduce the cost of collecting and sharing data with 65,000 active users
